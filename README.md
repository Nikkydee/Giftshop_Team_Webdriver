# Manual Testing
Software Testing is the process of verifying and validating a software application and ensuring that it meets specied required specification.
There is no exhaustive testing as a tester, my duty is minimize defects.
The skills required for Software Testing includes Communication skills, SQL Skills to query database, Hands on experience on Test Management tool like Azure Deveops,JIRA and Test Rail
Eye for details to detect defects,quality bug reporting skills.

Defect Life cycle
-Reproduce the defect  
-Assign the defect a priority and severity  
-Assign the defect to the development team  
-Retest the defect when fixed    
-Close the defect  

Types of Testing  
Manual Testing: process of testing an application to ensure it meets specified requirement.  
Acceptance Testing:is a test conducted whether to accept or reject a software application.  
System End-to-End Testing: Is the testing of software application to uncover defects.   
Functional Testing: This is testing the functional areas in an application.

Behaviour Driven Development using Gherkins
 
BDD helps to narrow communication gap between the development team wit real world examples. It also encorages collaboration between QA, developer and the non-technical participants

A feature file describes the single feature of a system. I can have multiple testcases. Feature can be likened to scenario
A background can be used in feature file if there repetitive steps
Here is an example of a Gherkin Language

Feature: Login Functionality

Scenario: Valid Login

Given I am on the Giftshop website  
When I click on login button  
And I enter user name   
And I enter password  
And I click on login button  
Then I am logged in

A testcase describes the test condition for a test scenario. It is composed of Testcase ID, Testcae scenario, Actual Result, Expected Result and Result/Status
